Description: # Python-Functools
        
        Since I just had some courses on Haskell and Kotlin, I found it intriguing to implement some of the functional tools in Python. For example, forEach and mapIndexed from Kotlin and ($) and scanl from Haskell. I've also included more intricate functions such as filter_acc, which can be used to build cool one-liners such as prime filterer with the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Check for the examples provided in the code.
        
        Additionally, I've added some null-handling (None-handling?) functions, such as one that imitates the Elvis Operator in Kotlin/Swift.
        
        I'll aim to make a fuller documentation during Christmas.
